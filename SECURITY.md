## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a top priority for this project. If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible.

Please do **NOT** report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via **GitHub Security Advisories** or by sending an email to the repository owner. 

We aim to:
- Acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- Provide a timeline for the fix and public disclosure.

Once we resolve the issue, we will publish a security advisory and credit you for the discovery.
